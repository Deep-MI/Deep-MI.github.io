  description: 'Martin is Assistant Professor of Radiology and of Neurology at Harvard
  Medical School and the Massachusetts General Hospital (Assistant in Neuroscience, Dept.
  of Radiology and Dept. of Neurology). He is Director of the Image Analysis (Deep-MI Lab)
  at the German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE), affiliated to the Martinos 
  Center for Biomedical Imaging and the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab.
  
  
  Martin started his career as a PhD student at the Welfenlab, Leibniz University of Hannover, Germany, 
  after graduating (2001) there in mathematics with a second major in computer science and a minor
  in business informatics. He obtained his PhD (2005) in the area of
  computational and differential geometry from the department of electrical engineering 
  and computer science with summa cum laude and was awarded a prize for his outstanding
  scientific accomplishments by the University of Hanover. 
   
   
  Supported by a Feodor-Lynen fellowship of the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation he moved 
  to MIT (2006-08) and contributed novel methods for non-rigid shape analysis and processing,
  receiving a most cited paper award of the 
  Computer-Aided Design journal for his ground-breaking manuscript on spectral shape analysis (ShapeDNA).
  Martin then moved to MGH/Harvard Medical School in 2008 and began his independent faculty career as
  Instructor at HMS in 2009/10 transitioning his focus to more applied medical image analysis topics. 
  He contributed novel methods for unbiased longitudinal image processing of brain MRI 
  and structural shape analysis for computer-aided diagnosis and prognosis. His methods are 
  widely employed as part of the open source FreeSurfer software package to study neurodegeneration and 
  assess disease modifying therapies, e.g., by the Alzheimer`s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative,
  the Rhineland Study, and other large cohort studies.
  
  
  After receiving a competitive NIH Career Award (2014) for his research on computational methods for medical image
  analysis, Martin was appointed Assistant Professor by both the Radiology and the Neurology Departments
  at Harvard Medical School in 2015. He, further, accepted (2017) the offer to direct the Medical Image
  Analysis at the German Centerfor Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE) in Bonn, Germany. During his career
  so far, Martin has attracted close to $3 mio worth of 3rd party funding.'
