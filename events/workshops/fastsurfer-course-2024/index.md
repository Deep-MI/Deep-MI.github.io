The **DeepMI lab** is happy to announce the **DeepMI FastSurfer / FreeSurfer course**, a two-day, hands-on, introductory course on state-of-the-art deep-learning methods for fast and reliable neuroimage analysis. 

The goal of the course is to equip participants with working knowledge about fundamental concepts in structural neuroimaging analysis, and enable them to conduct analyses of structural imaging data using the [FastSurfer](https://deep-mi.org/research/fastsurfer) and [FreeSurfer](https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu) software packages. 

After completing the course, participants will have gained an understanding of modern methods for the analysis of structural brain images, will have learned how to run both the *FastSurfer* and *FreeSurfer* softwares, and will know how to set up an analysis and work with the resulting outputs in the context of their own research projects.

The course consists of lectures, demonstrations, practical exercises, and provides ample opportunities for discussions and informal exchange.

## Dates 

The course will be held on **September 26 and 27, 2024** (Thursday and Friday) between **9:15 am and 4:30 pm**.

## Places

The course takes place at the **German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE)** in Bonn, Germany ([directions](/events/workshops/fastsurfer-course-2024/location)). 

## Topics

The course will cover the following topics:

- [Introduction to structural neuroimaging](/events/workshops/fastsurfer-course-2024/program#introduction-to-structural-neuroimaging): an overview of the FastSurfer and FreeSurfer software packages and what they can do 
- [Advanced deep-learning for image segmentation](/events/workshops/fastsurfer-course-2024/program#advanced-deep-learning-for-image-segmentation): fast and reliable anatomical segmentation -- the core module of the FastSurfer software
- [Surface models](/events/workshops/fastsurfer-course-2024/program#surface-models): how to create surface models and extract a rich set of anatomical features
- [Statistical modeling and inference](/events/workshops/fastsurfer-course-2024/program#statistical-modeling-and-inference): how to arrive at conclusions -- the evaluation and interpretation of results
- [QC, troubleshooting, and practical issues](/events/workshops/fastsurfer-course-2024/program#qc-troubleshooting-and-practical-issues): how to trust your results -- solutions to potential pitfalls and issues 
- [The FastSurfer ecosystem](/events/workshops/fastsurfer-course-2024/program#the-fastsurfer-ecosystem): specialized applications, add-on modules, and an outlook to future developments

## Social event

We are planning to conclude the first day of the course (Thursday) at the ["Waldau" restaurant](https://waldau-restaurant.de), which is a nice 15 min walk from the DZNE and can also be reached by bus in a few minutes. We will guide one group going by foot, and one group going by bus, right after the course at around 5 pm. For those wanting to join later, the address is "An der Waldau 50", and the closest bus stop is "Waldau" (served by line 602). Information about the bus schedules is available from the [VRS website](https://www.vrs.de).
