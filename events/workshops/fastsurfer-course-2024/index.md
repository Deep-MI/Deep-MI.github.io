The DeepMI lab is happy to announce a two-day, hands-on, introductory courseon state-of-the-art deep-learning methods for fast and reliable neuroimage analysis. 

The goal of the course is to equip participants with working knowledge about fundamental concepts in structural neuroimaging analysis, and enable them to conduct analyses of structural imaging data using the [FastSurfer](https://deep-mi.org/research/fastsurfer) and [FreeSurfer](https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu) software packages. It consists of lectures, demonstrations, practical exercises, and provides ample opportunities for discussions and informal exchange.

## Dates 

The course will be held on **TBD** (... weekdays ...) **between 9:15 am and 4:30 pm**.

## Places

The course takes place at the Venusberg Campus of the   **German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE)** in Bonn, Germany ([directions](/events/workshops/fastsurfer-course-2024/location)). 

## Topics

The course will cover topics such as: (this should be non-technical, narrative, somewhat catchy ...)

- Introduction to structural neuroimaging
- Advanced deep-learning for image segmentation: ...
- Surface-based modeling: ...
- Statistical analysis: evaluation and interpretation of results
- Troubleshooting and practical issues: ...
- The FastSurfer ecosystem: current state and an outlook to the future
