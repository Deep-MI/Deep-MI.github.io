# Location

The German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (Deutsches Zentrum für Neurodegenerative Erkrankungen, DZNE) is located at the Venusberg campus of the university hospital, its address is "Building 99, Venusberg-Campus 1". The most convenient way to get from Bonn main ststion to the DZNE is by bus. From Bonn main station, cross the street towards the city center to get to the bus station. At the bus station, take line 601 towards the direction "Venusberg / Uniklinikum" until its final stop "Uniklinikum Süd"; don’t take the 601 bus towards "Tannenbusch" (which is the opposite direction). The bus towards "Venusberg / Uniklinikum" typically leaves at platform A1, roughly every 10 mins.

When arriving at the "Uniklinikum Süd" bus stop, follow the road until the roundabout, then turn left. The DZNE is located approximately 100m from the bus stop, and it’s a huge black building with colorful windows.
