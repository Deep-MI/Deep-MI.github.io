The DeepMI FastSurfer/FreeSurfer course will be divided into several modules that give a comprehensive overview of the FastSurfer and FreeSurfer software packages and provide detailed guidance for their application in your own research. After an **introduction**, the <span style="color:#87bebd">**segmentation**</span> module will cover advanced deep-learning methods for image segmentation. The <span style="color:#31727c">**surface**</span> module will explain how 3D surface models are created from brain images. The <span style="color:#924125">**group analysis**</span> module will discuss statistical modeling and inference, and the <span style="color:#272592">**QC and Add-ons**</span> module provides QC and troubleshooting tips as well as an outlook into the current and future FastSurfer ecosystem. All lectures will be accompanied by demos and/or practical exercises.

This module provides an **overview** of the FastSurfer / FreeSurfer software packages, their image processing pipelines, and the resulting metrics for quantifying anatomical properties of the human brain. This includes:
- A brief introduction to artificial intelligence and human neuroimaging research
- Application of FastSurfer and FreeSurfer in human neuroimaging studies
- Properties, commonalities and differences of the FastSurfer and FreeSurfer software packages

This module also includes a short tutorial on working with our Linux workstations and on running scripts via the command line.

This session covers the core module of the FastSurfer software -- fast and reliable **anatomical segmentation**. We will focus on the analysis of individual cases and discuss the following topics:
- Deep-learning-based segmentation of anatomical brain images
- From images to metrics: quantification of anatomical information
- Pipelines, commands, outputs: practical and technical aspects 
- How to get everything up and running: installation, setup, and deployment of the FastSurfer and FreeSurfer software

This module includes a practical session during which particpants can conduct their own segmentation analysis using FastSurfer and evaluate the resulting output.

## <span style="color:#31727c">**Surface models**</span>

This module continues the analysis of individual cases and introduces the creation of **surface models** and how they can be used to extract a rich set of anatomical features. It will cover the following topics:
- What are surface models - and why should we use them?
- What surface-based outputs can we get - and how can we use them?
- Surface registration and the preparation of statistical analysis

A practical session will allow participants to become familiar with the full FastSurfer / FreeSurfer output as well as the Freeview program, our primary tool for the visualization and inspection of individual results.

## <span style="color:#924125">**Statistical modeling and inference**</span>

This module covers **statistical modeling and inference**. We will address how data from individual cases can be aggregated at the group level for the purpose of answering applied research questions (e.g., group differences, association studies). We will discuss:
- Application of the general linear model in neuroimaging analyses
- The statistical design: hypotheses, contrasts, statistical parameters
- Multiple comparison correction in mass-univariate analyses
- Commands, output files, and visualization using the Freeview software

A practical session covers the complete workflow of an analysis at the group level, using preprocessed data from a prototypical study.

## <span style="color:#272592">**QC, troubleshooting, and practical issues**</span>

This module illustrates potential **pitfalls and issues** during a FastSurfer / FreeSurfer analysis, and provides suggestions for mitigating them. It will cover:
- Quality control: automatic and visual inspection of processing results
- Troubleshooting: what to do in case of processing failures or segmentation errors
- Caveats: scenarios when (and how) to use FastSurfer or FreeSurfer - and when not

During a practical session, participants will learn how to apply strategies and techniques for quality checking. We will also discuss what output can be expected from a FastSurfer/FreeSurfer analysis, and when to proceed with caution.

## <span style="color:#272592">**The FastSurfer ecosystem**</span>

The final module introduces the **FastSurfer ecosystem**, i.e. the set of software tools that extend and smoothly interoperate with the core FastSurfer software. We also give an outlook about future directions in the development of the software. We will cover:
- Specialized application scenarios: infants, lesions, high-resolution or high field-strength data
- Add-on modules for Amygdala/Hippocampus, Thalamus, Hypothalamus, Olfactory Bulb, brainstem, Cerebellum
- Outlook to ongoing and planned developments; interaction with the FastSurfer user community

The course concludes with a question-and-answer session about any potentially remaining issues. There will also be opportunites to meet the speakers individually.
