# Welcome to MIND Lab!
{: .display-4}

Our research in MIND mainly focuses on the discovery of fundamental principles of brain structural and functional architectures and their relationship, via brain imaging, computational modeling and machine learning methods. We are interested in the interaction between Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Human Intelligence (HI): Using Deep Learning to facilitate the analysis and interpretation of brain data; Applying neuroscience knowledge to design more efficient Deep Learning architectures. We also have strong interests in applying the discovered principles, theories and methods to better understand neurodevelopmental, neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders including Autism, Alzheimerâ€™s disease, and Major Depression, among other brain conditions.
