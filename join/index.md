Our lab doesnâ€™t always post for specific positions, so please reach out! We are interested in engaging you in a conversation about your scientific background and goals for your future career (in academia, industry, or other ventures). 

# Graduate Students

If you are a student with an outstanding track record (e.g. a relevant publication in deep learning for medical image analysis) please contact us. We currently have no open positions, though, but could explore external funding mechanisms. 

# Master Students

We can offer various exciting topics for your Master Thesis project in our lab. Please contact us for details.

# Other

In the past, our lab has enjoyed having foreign exchange students, interns, (sabbatical) visitors from academia and industry.

Note: We take interns only if their internship is an official University requirement as part of their curriculum.
