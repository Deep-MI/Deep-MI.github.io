As yet, there are no in vivo data on tissue water changes and associated morphometric changes involved in the osmo-adaptation of normal brains. Our aim was to evaluate osmoadaptive responses of the healthy human brain to osmotic challenges of de- and rehydration by serial measurements of brain volume, tissue fluid, and metabolites.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}MATERIALS AND METHODS:{\textless}/h3{\textgreater}



Serial T1-weighted and {\textless}sup{\textgreater}1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}H-MR spectroscopy data were acquired in 15 healthy individuals at normohydration, on 12 hours of dehydration, and during 1 hour of oral rehydration. Osmotic challenges were monitored by serum measures, including osmolality and hematocrit. MR imaging data were analyzed by using FreeSurfer and LCModel.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}RESULTS:{\textless}/h3{\textgreater}



On dehydration, serum osmolality increased by 0.67{\%} and brain tissue fluid decreased by 1.63{\%}, on average. MR imaging morphometry demonstrated corresponding decreases of cortical thickness and volumes of the whole brain, cortex, white matter, and hypothalamus/thalamus. These changes reversed during rehydration. Continuous fluid ingestion of 1 L of water for 1 hour within the scanner lowered serum osmolality by 0.96{\%} and increased brain tissue fluid by 0.43{\%}, on average. Concomitantly, cortical thickness and volumes of the whole brain, cortex, white matter, and hypothalamus/thalamus increased. Changes in brain tissue fluid were related to volume changes of the whole brain, the white matter, and hypothalamus/thalamus. Only volume changes of the hypothalamus/thalamus significantly correlated with serum osmolality.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}CONCLUSIONS:{\textless}/h3{\textgreater}



This is the first study simultaneously evaluating changes in brain tissue fluid, metabolites, volume, and cortical thickness. Our results reflect cellular volume regulatory mechanisms at a macroscopic level and emphasize that it is essential to control for hydration levels in studies on brain morphometry and metabolism in order to avoid confounding the findings.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},
